# ICONS Character sheet maker

### About
This is a python 3 application that uses the library [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) for handling the form and the library [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for taking the character sheet pdf and adding the character text to it.

### Setup instructions
Clone the repo then install Flask and Pillow using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) `pip install`. Run the application by using `py index.py` or `python index.py` if you are using Python 2.
